# Task: Analyze Product Performance and Supply Chain Efficiency
1. Dataset Preparation
Ensure the dataset contains all the columns mentioned above.

# 2. Created Visualizations
Product Performance Dashboard
Product Sales: Created a bar chart showing the number of products sold for each Product Type.
Price Distribution: Used a histogram to show the distribution of prices for different Product Types.
Stock Levels: Created a heat map to visualize stock levels across different SKUs and Product Types.

Supply Chain Efficiency Dashboard
Lead Times vs. Order Quantities: Used a scatter plot to analyze the relationship between lead times and order quantities across different Supplier names.
Shipping Costs by Carrier: Created a bar chart showing shipping costs per shipping carrier, filtered by Location.

Defect Rates: Created a pie chart or bar chart to visualize defect rates by Supplier name or Location.
Customer Demographics
Demographic Breakdown: Created a demographic distribution chart (such as a pie chart or stacked bar chart) to show the breakdown of customers by age group, gender, or other demographics.
Revenue by Demographics: Used a treemap to show revenue generated segmented by customer demographics.

# 3. Analyzed Questions
Which Product Type generates the highest revenue?
Are there significant correlations between lead times and order quantities?
How do shipping costs vary by shipping carrier and location?
Which suppliers have the most efficient manufacturing processes based on manufacturing lead time and production volumes?
What demographic group contributes the most to sales?
